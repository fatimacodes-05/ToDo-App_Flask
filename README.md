# ToDo-App_Flask
Flask TODO App is a simple and secure web-based task manager built using Flask, allowing users to register, log in, and manage their personal tasks. Each user can create, view, update, and delete their own TODO items. The app supports search, pagination, and enforces user-specific data access using session-based authentication.
